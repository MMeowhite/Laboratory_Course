The left and right part of the equal sign is called variable and value just like this `varible = value`. Variables are used to store data values. For example The statement `a = 1` and ` = true` represents `a,1`and `b,true` are varibles and values, respectively. The variable could be named by letter , number 0-9, special sign @#$%^&* *ect* and their abtrary combiations. But They follow certain rules and conventions that ensure they are named and accessed correctly. Below are the key rules for defining and using variables in Python.\n","- **Start with a letter or an underscore**:  <br/>\n","A variable name must begin with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (`_`).\n","  - Valid: `my_variable`, `_variable`\n","  - Invalid: `1variable` (<u>cannot start with a number</u>)\n","\n","- **Followed by letters, numbers, or underscores**: <br/>\n","After the first letter, the variable name can include numbers (0-9), letters (a-z, A-Z), and underscores (`_`).\n","  - Valid: `my_variable2`, `variable_123`\n","  - Invalid: `my-variable` (hyphens are not allowed)\n","\n","- **Case-sensitive**: <br/>\n","Python is case-sensitive, meaning that `Variable`, `variable`, and `VARIABLE` are considered different variables.\n","  - `myVariable` and `myvariable` are two distinct variables.\n","\n","- **No reserved keywords**: <br/>\n","A variable name cannot be a Python reserved keyword, such as `if`, `for`, `else`, `True`, `None`, `class`, `import`, etc.\n","  - Invalid: `if`, `else`, `while`, `try`, etc.\n","\n","In Python, variables are dynamically typed, meaning you do not need to declare their type explicitly. You can directly assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator `=`.\n","```python\n","x = 10         # integer\n","name = \"John\"  # string\n","is_active = True # boolean\n","```\n","\n","Otherwise, Python allows multiple variables to be assigned in a single line, separated by commas.\n","```python\n","x, y, z = 5, 3.14, \"Hello\" # multiple assignments, x is assigned 5, y is assigned 3.14 and z is assigned hello\n","```\n","\n","<br/>\n","\n","\n","### 1.2 Variable and Data type\n","Python is a weak language type in contrast to C,C++,Java. It means you do not define data type exactly when you want to creat a new data. But we still know the variable and data type in python, it will be benefit when you start learning `PyTorch` or `Tensorflow` library. In this part, I list some common variable and data type in the following context:\n","\n","  - Numeric Types:\n","    - **int**: Integer (whole numbers) <br/>\n","      Example: `x = 5`\n","    - **float**: Floating-point number (decimal numbers) <br/> Example: `y = 3.14`\n","    - **complex**: Complex numbers <br/>\n","      Example: `z = 1 + 2j`\n","  - Sequence Types:\n","    - **list**: Ordered, mutable collection <br/>\n","      Example: `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`\n","    - **tuple**: Ordered, immutable collection <br/>\n","      Example: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`\n","    - **range**: Immutable sequence of numbers, used for loops<br/>\n","      Example: `my_range = range(5)`\n","  - Text Type:\n","    - **string**: String (a sequence of characters) <br/>\n","      Example: `name = \"John\"`\n","  - Mapping Type:\n","    - **dict**: Dictionary (unordered collection of key-value pairs) <br/>\n","      Example: `my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}`\n","  - Set Types:\n","    - **set**: Unordered collection of unique elements <br/>\n","      Example: `my_set = {1, 2, 3}`\n","    - **frozenset**: Immutable set <br/>\n","      Example: `my_frozenset = frozenset([1, 2, 3])`\n","  - Boolean Type:\n","      - **bool**: Boolean value, either True or False <br/>\n","      Example: `is_valid = True`\n","  - Binary Types:\n","      - **bytes**: Immutable sequence of bytes <br/>\n","      Example: `b = b\"hello\" (01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111)`\n","      - **bytearray**: Mutable sequence of bytes <br/>\n","      Example: `ba = bytearray([65, 66, 67])`\n","      - **memoryview**: View of memory in byte format <br/>\n","      Example: `m = memoryview(b\"hello\")`\n","\n","You should konw your data type of variable in your code in any place to avoid type error.\n","\n","Meanwhile, Python is dynamically typed, meaning the type of a variable can change during runtime. You can reassign a variable to a different type at any time.\n","```python\n","x = 10       # x is an integer\n","x = \"Hello\"  # now x is a string\n","```\n","\n","<br/>\n","\n","### 1.3 Control Flow Statement\n","Control flow statements are used to decide the execution path of a program, including conditional statements, loops, and branching structures. Python provides several control flow statements to implement different program logic. We will talk about later chapter when we use it.\n","\n","\n","<br/>\n","\n","### 1.4 Function\n","This guide will walk you through the basics of writing and using functions in Python. Functions allow you to group code into reusable blocks, making your program more modular and easier to maintain.\n","\n","What is function in python? A **function** in Python is a block of code that only runs when it is called. You can pass data (known as **parameters**) into a function, and it can return data as well.\n","How can we define a function in python? In Python, you define a function using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses, and a colon. The body of the function starts on the next line, indented.\n","\n","```python\n","# python function syntax\n","def function_name(parameters):\n","    # Function body\n","    # Code to execute\n","    return result  # Optional return value\n","\n","# For example    \n","def greet():\n","    print(\"Hello, welcome to Python functions!\") # In this example, the function greet will print a welcome message when called.\n","\n","\n","```   \n","How to calling a function? Once a function is defined, you can call it by using its name followed by parentheses.\n","\n","```python\n","greet() # Calling the function to print the message\n","```\n","\n","How can we define and use a python function with parameters? A function can accept parameters (inputs) that allow you to pass data into the function for processing. Parameters are placed inside the parentheses.\n","```python\n","def function_name(parameter1, parameter2):\n","    # Code to execute\n","    # value to return\n","    return value\n","```\n","For example, I define a function to return the sum of two parameter\n","```python\n","def sum(a, b)\n","    result = a + b\n","    return result\n","a = 1\n","b = 2\n","c = sum(a, b)\n","print(c) #the output will be sum of a and b\n","```\n","\n","Notes: if you haven't any code to execute and any value to return, you should use built-in keywords pass to avoid compile syntax error.\n","\n","```python\n","def null_function(a, b):\n","    pass\n","```\n","\n","How can we define a python function with default parameters? You can assign default values to parameters. If the caller does not provide a value for that parameter, the default value is used.\n","\n","```python\n","def greet(name=\"Guest\"):\n","    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n","\n","greet(\"Alice\")  # Output: Hello, Alice!\n","greet()         # Output: Hello, Guest!\n","```\n","\n","When you write your own code, you also should be careful about the variable scope. The varibale scope could be divided into two types: **Local Variables** and **Global Variables**.\n","- **Local Variables**: Variables declared inside a function are local to that function and cannot be accessed outside of it.\n","- **Global Variables**: Variables declared outside of a function are global and can be accessed from anywhere in the code.\n","\n","```python\n","x = 10  # Global variable\n","\n","def my_function():\n","    y = 5  # Local variable\n","    print(x + y)\n","\n","my_function()  # Output: 15\n","print(x) # This will be output 10 correctly because x is local to the entire code\n","# print(y)  # This will raise an error because y is local to the function\n","```\n","\n","Notes: Python also allows you to define **anonymous functions** using the **lambda** keyword. These functions are typically used for short-term, one-line operations.\n","```python\n","lambda parameters: expression\n","```\n","For example, if we want to return the square of any number, we can use lambda expression.\n","```python\n","square = lambda x: x ** 2\n","print(square(4))  # Output: 16\n","```\n","\n","In summary, functions are a fundamental part of Python programming. They allow you to:\n","- Group code into reusable blocks\n","- Accept inputs via parameters\n","- Return values with the return keyword\n","- Use default values and handle variable scope\n","\n","\n","<br/>\n","\n","In the last, I recommand you to read this documents Thoroughly [ **Python Numpy Tutorial(with Jupyter and Colab): https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/**  ] completed by *CS231n* course teacher group in *Compuer Science Deparment of Standford University*.

Burges  \\n**Source**: [MNIST Website](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) - Date unknown  \\n**Please cite**:  \\n\\nThe MNIST database of handwritten digits with 784 features, raw data available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. It can be split in a training set of the first 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples  \\n\\nIt is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image. It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting. The original black and white (bilevel) images from NIST were size normalized to fit in a 20x20 pixel box while preserving their aspect ratio. The resulting images contain grey levels as a result of the anti-aliasing technique used by the normalization algorithm. the images were centered in a 28x28 image by computing the center of mass of the pixels, and translating the image so as to position this point at the center of the 28x28 field.  \\n\\nWith some classification methods (particularly template-based methods, such as SVM and K-nearest neighbors), the error rate improves when the digits are centered by bounding box rather than center of mass. If you do this kind of pre-processing, you should report it in your publications. The MNIST database was constructed from NIST's NIST originally designated SD-3 as their training set and SD-1 as their test set. However, SD-3 is much cleaner and easier to recognize than SD-1. The reason for this can be found on the fact that SD-3 was collected among Census Bureau employees, while SD-1 was collected among high-school students. Drawing sensible conclusions from learning experiments requires that the result be independent of the choice of training set and test among the complete set of samples. Therefore it was necessary to build a new database by mixing NIST's datasets.  \\n\\nThe MNIST training set is composed of 30,000 patterns from SD-3 and 30,000 patterns from SD-1. Our test set was composed of 5,000 patterns from SD-3 and 5,000 patterns from SD-1. The 60,000 pattern training set contained examples from approximately 250 writers. We made sure that the sets of writers of the training set and test set were disjoint. SD-1 contains 58,527 digit images written by 500 different writers. In contrast to SD-3, where blocks of data from each writer appeared in sequence, the data in SD-1 is scrambled. Writer identities for SD-1 is available and we used this information to unscramble the writers. We then split SD-1 in two: characters written by the first 250 writers went into our new training set. The remaining 250 writers were placed in our test set. Thus we had two sets with nearly 30,000 examples each. The new training set was completed with enough examples from SD-3, starting at pattern # 0, to make a full set of 60,000 training patterns. Similarly, the new test set was completed with SD-3 examples starting at pattern # 35,000 to make a full set with 60,000 test patterns. Only a subset of 10,000 test images (5,000 from SD-1 and 5,000 from SD-3) is available on this site. The full 60,000 sample training set is available.\\n\\nDownloaded from openml.org.\", 'details': {'id': '554', 'name': 'mnist_784', 'version': '1', 'description_version': '2', 'format': 'ARFF', 'creator': ['Yann LeCun', 'Corinna Cortes', 'Christopher J.C.

Burges  \n","**Source**: [MNIST Website](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) - Date unknown  \n","**Please cite**:  \n","\n","The MNIST database of handwritten digits with 784 features, raw data available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. It can be split in a training set of the first 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples  \n","\n","It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image. It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting. The original black and white (bilevel) images from NIST were size normalized to fit in a 20x20 pixel box while preserving their aspect ratio. The resulting images contain grey levels as a result of the anti-aliasing technique used by the normalization algorithm. the images were centered in a 28x28 image by computing the center of mass of the pixels, and translating the image so as to position this point at the center of the 28x28 field.  \n","\n","With some classification methods (particularly template-based methods, such as SVM and K-nearest neighbors), the error rate improves when the digits are centered by bounding box rather than center of mass. If you do this kind of pre-processing, you should report it in your publications. The MNIST database was constructed from NIST's NIST originally designated SD-3 as their training set and SD-1 as their test set. However, SD-3 is much cleaner and easier to recognize than SD-1. The reason for this can be found on the fact that SD-3 was collected among Census Bureau employees, while SD-1 was collected among high-school students. Drawing sensible conclusions from learning experiments requires that the result be independent of the choice of training set and test among the complete set of samples. Therefore it was necessary to build a new database by mixing NIST's datasets.  \n","\n","The MNIST training set is composed of 30,000 patterns from SD-3 and 30,000 patterns from SD-1. Our test set was composed of 5,000 patterns from SD-3 and 5,000 patterns from SD-1. The 60,000 pattern training set contained examples from approximately 250 writers. We made sure that the sets of writers of the training set and test set were disjoint. SD-1 contains 58,527 digit images written by 500 different writers. In contrast to SD-3, where blocks of data from each writer appeared in sequence, the data in SD-1 is scrambled. Writer identities for SD-1 is available and we used this information to unscramble the writers. We then split SD-1 in two: characters written by the first 250 writers went into our new training set. The remaining 250 writers were placed in our test set. Thus we had two sets with nearly 30,000 examples each. The new training set was completed with enough examples from SD-3, starting at pattern # 0, to make a full set of 60,000 training patterns. Similarly, the new test set was completed with SD-3 examples starting at pattern # 35,000 to make a full set with 60,000 test patterns. Only a subset of 10,000 test images (5,000 from SD-1 and 5,000 from SD-3) is available on this site. The full 60,000 sample training set is available.\n","\n","Downloaded from openml.org.\n","\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","\n","mnist.categories:
